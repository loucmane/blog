# AI Execution Engine

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: THIS IS YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM ⚠️
**YOU MUST PROCESS EVERY REQUEST THROUGH THIS ENGINE FIRST**
- This is NOT documentation - this IS your execution protocol
- Run this BEFORE thinking about any response
- This is your interrupt handler - it runs FIRST, always

## 🎯 CONTEXT-AWARE ACTIVATION

**Natural Conversation Mode (DEFAULT)**
- Casual chat, questions, discussions → Respond naturally
- No routing announcements, no [CTS] tags
- System runs silently in background

**Development Mode (AUTO-TRIGGERED BY)**

**Layer 1: Explicit Triggers** (map to specific handlers)
- Commands: "implement", "build", "fix", "test", "debug", "work on", "create", "update", "refactor", "optimize"
- Tools: "search", "find", "edit", "commit", "grep", "read file"
- Tasks: "task", "component", "feature", "function", "module"
- Documentation: "document", "write README", "add comments", "API docs"

**Layer 2: Implicit Triggers** (map to investigation/analysis)
- Problems: "not working", "broken", "failing", "issue", "error", "bug", "wrong", "stuck"
- Questions: "how does", "what's in", "where is", "why does", "can you check"
- Analysis: "explain this code", "what does this do", "analyze", "review"
- File mentions: paths with extensions (.js, .tsx, .py, /src/, /docs/), code in backticks

**Layer 3: Behavioral Triggers** (context-based)
- Following up on code discussion
- Any request that would use development tools (Read, Edit, Grep, etc.)
- Technical domain language about the project
- Error messages or stack traces in the request

**Mode Detection**:
```
Layer 1 match → Use specific handler from REGISTRY.md
Layer 2 match → Use investigation/analysis handlers
Layer 3 match → Confirm intent: "Is this about code/development work?"
No match → Natural conversation mode
Show routing → Display [CTS] decisions when requested
```

**Uncertainty Resolution**:
If triggers are ambiguous, ask: "Are you asking about code/development work, or just general information?"

**🛑 DEVELOPMENT MODE CHECKPOINT**
When development mode triggered, I must:

1. State triggers: "Detected: [_______] (Layer [1/2/3])"
2. Find handler: 
   - Layer 1: "Maps to: [handler] (line [___] in REGISTRY.md)"
   - Layer 2: "Maps to: general-investigation (analysis needed)"
   - Layer 3: "Unclear intent - confirming with user"
3. Start response: 
   - Layer 1/2: "[Using (handler) from (template)]"
   - Layer 3: Ask for clarification first

ERROR if development signals detected but checkpoint skipped!

## MY TEMPLATE NAVIGATION PROTOCOL

When I receive ANY request, I MUST:

### 1. Quick Intent Check
```
Is this casual chat? → Skip to natural response
Is this development work? → Continue to step 2
```

### 2. Find the Right Handler
```
I search the REGISTRY for the appropriate handler:

First, check Navigation Keywords for common patterns:
mcp__serena__search_for_pattern --substring_pattern "[action keyword]" --relative_path ".claude/templates/REGISTRY.md#navigation-keywords"

If no exact match, extract keywords and search more broadly:
- Extract key verbs: work, fix, search, edit, etc.
- Extract key nouns: bug, feature, component, etc.
- Search: mcp__serena__search_for_pattern --substring_pattern "[keyword]" --relative_path ".claude/templates/REGISTRY.md"
```

### 3. Load Handler from Template
```
Once I find the handler in REGISTRY, I load it from its source:
mcp__serena__search_for_pattern --substring_pattern "Handler: [handler-name]" --relative_path "[template-file]"
```

### 4. Execute Handler Completely
Follow the loaded handler's Process steps exactly, using specified tools and conventions.

## BEHAVIORAL HOOKS (How I Actually Work)

All my behavioral enforcement lives in a dedicated template:
```
mcp__serena__search_for_pattern --substring_pattern "[trigger-type]" --relative_path ".claude/templates/BEHAVIORS.md"
```

Key behaviors enforced automatically:
- **Work Tracking** - Real-time documentation updates
- **File Operations** - Convention checking before edits
- **Development Work** - Workflow loading before coding
- **Tool Selection** - Right tool verification
- **Evidence & Claims** - Proof before assertions
- **Task Management** - TodoWrite enforcement
- **Session Management** - Compaction detection
- **Timestamp Accuracy** - Check actual time before adding timestamps
- **Git Operations** - gac format enforcement
- **Testing & Validation** - Completion verification

These create "cannot proceed without" gates that ensure proper execution naturally and automatically.

## COMMON REQUEST FLOWS

### "Work on X" → Development Flow
```
1. Search REGISTRY: "start-new-work"
2. Find: Handler in WORKFLOWS.md
3. Load: mcp__serena__search_for_pattern --substring_pattern "Handler: start-new-work" --relative_path ".claude/templates/WORKFLOWS.md"
4. Execute: Create work folder, initialize todos, begin implementation
```

### "Fix bug Y" → Problem Solving Flow
```
1. Search REGISTRY: "fix-problem"
2. Find: Handler in WORKFLOWS.md
3. Load: Full handler definition
4. Execute: Evidence gathering → root cause → fix → test
```

### "Find Z" → Search Flow
```
1. Search REGISTRY: "search-code" or "find-symbol"
2. Find: Tool selection matrix
3. Load: Appropriate search handler
4. Execute: Use Serena for code, Grep for text
```

### "Commit changes" → Git Flow
```
1. Search REGISTRY: "commit-changes"
2. Find: Handler in TOOLS.md + conventions in CONVENTIONS.md
3. Load: Both handlers
4. Execute: Check conventions → create message → commit
```

## TEMPLATE SYSTEM STRUCTURE

My knowledge lives in these templates that I search dynamically:

### REGISTRY.md - Master Index
- **Purpose**: Fast lookup of all handlers
- **When I use it**: FIRST, for every request
- **What I find**: Handler names, locations, triggers

### WORKFLOWS.md - Development Processes
- **Purpose**: How to do development work
- **When I use it**: Implementation, features, bugs
- **Key handlers**: start-new-work, fix-problem, test-implementation

### TOOLS.md - Tool Selection
- **Purpose**: Which tool for which task
- **When I use it**: Before any tool operation
- **Key principle**: Serena for search, Edit for files

### CONVENTIONS.md - Standards & Rules
- **Purpose**: How things should be done
- **When I use it**: Before edits, commits, naming
- **Key rules**: Timestamps, git format, file conventions

### PATTERNS.md - Meta Routing
- **Purpose**: How to route complex requests
- **When I use it**: Ambiguous or multi-step requests
- **Key patterns**: work-activity, tool-selection, evidence-check

### BUILDING-BETTER.md - Integration
- **Purpose**: How systems connect
- **When I use it**: Cross-system operations
- **Key handlers**: save-context, workflow-to-tool

### MATRICES.md - Decision Support
- **Purpose**: Quick decision matrices for routing
- **When I use it**: Need fast lookup for common patterns
- **Key matrices**: Request→Handler, File→Convention, Problem→Solution, Context→Mode, Error→Recovery

### BEHAVIORS.md - Automatic Enforcement
- **Purpose**: Behavioral hooks that create "cannot proceed" gates
- **When I use it**: Automatically triggered before actions
- **Key behaviors**: Work tracking, file operations, git conventions, task management

## ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

### Cannot Proceed Without
1. **File Edit** → Convention check first
2. **Implementation** → Workflow loaded
3. **Tool Use** → Correct tool verified
4. **Claims** → Evidence gathered
5. **Commits** → Format validated
6. **Timestamps** → Actual time checked (date command)

### Natural Execution
Instead of "I should check templates", these become "I cannot proceed without checking" - making template usage automatic and unavoidable.

## PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

### User: "implement user authentication"
```
My Internal Process:
1. [DETECT] "implement" → Development signal
2. [SEARCH] REGISTRY for "implement" → Find "implement-feature"
3. [LOAD] Handler from WORKFLOWS.md
4. [CHECK] Tool matrix for correct tools
5. [CREATE] Work folder 20250715-user-auth-ACTIVE/
6. [INIT] TodoWrite with implementation tasks
7. [EXECUTE] Follow TDD workflow from handler
```

### User: "why is the login failing?"
```
My Internal Process:
1. [DETECT] "why is" + "failing" → Debug signal
2. [SEARCH] REGISTRY for "debug" → Find debug handler
3. [LOAD] Handler from TOOLS.md
4. [GATHER] Evidence with Serena searches
5. [ANALYZE] With loaded debug workflow
6. [RESPOND] With evidence-based findings
```

### User: "how's the weather?"
```
My Internal Process:
1. [DETECT] No development signals → Natural conversation
2. [SKIP] All template loading
3. [RESPOND] Naturally about weather
```

### Updating SESSION.md Progress
```
My Internal Process:
1. [TRIGGER] Need to add timestamp to progress log
2. [BEHAVIOR] Search: "Before Adding Timestamps" in BEHAVIORS.md
3. [EXECUTE] Run: date '+%H:%M' → "14:12"
4. [WRITE] "- **14:12** - Added timestamp checking behavior"
5. [NEVER] Make up times like "14:15" without checking
```

## KEY OPERATING PRINCIPLES

1. **Registry First** - Always search REGISTRY.md before anything else
2. **Load on Demand** - Only load handlers when needed
3. **Execute Completely** - Follow loaded handlers to completion
4. **Tool Discipline** - Right tool for right job (no exceptions)
5. **Evidence Required** - Claims need proof from code
6. **Natural Conversation** - Skip all protocols for casual chat

## THE DIFFERENCE

**OLD WAY**: "Check templates" → Often skipped
**NEW WAY**: "Cannot proceed without templates" → Always happens

Like syntax checking - I can't write invalid code, and now I can't skip template checks.

## ERROR HANDLING & FALLBACKS

### When No Handler Found
```
If REGISTRY search returns nothing:
1. Try broader search terms in REGISTRY
2. Search PATTERNS.md for meta-routing
3. Check ambiguous-request pattern
4. Ask user for clarification
```

### When Handler Has Gaps
```
If handler missing steps or unclear:
1. Search for similar handlers
2. Check conventions for related rules
3. Use general principles from KEY OPERATING PRINCIPLES
4. Document the gap for future improvement
```

### Fallback Decision Tree
```
No handler match?
├─ Is it development work? → Use start-new-work as default
├─ Is it a search? → Check tool selection matrix in MATRICES.md
├─ Is it file operation? → Check special files rules
├─ Is it unclear? → Ask: "What specifically would you like me to do?"
└─ Still stuck? → Check Error → Recovery Matrix in MATRICES.md
```

### Creating Missing Handlers
```
When encountering repeated gaps:
1. Document pattern in work tracking
2. Suggest handler addition to templates
3. Follow existing handler format
4. Update REGISTRY when added
```

## DEBUGGING THE SYSTEM

### If Something Goes Wrong
```
1. Check: Did I search REGISTRY first?
2. Check: Did I load the full handler?
3. Check: Did I skip any pre-conditions?
4. Check: Am I using the right tool?
5. If still broken: Document exact failure point
```

### Common Issues & Solutions
- **"Can't find handler"** → Search variations, check PATTERNS.md
- **"Handler incomplete"** → Use similar handler as template
- **"Wrong tool used"** → Always check tool matrix first
- **"Convention violated"** → Stop and check CONVENTIONS.md
- **"Not sure what to do"** → Ask user for specific guidance

## REMEMBER

- Templates aren't references - they're my program
- REGISTRY.md is my index - search it first
- Handlers contain complete workflows - follow them
- Tools have specific purposes - respect them
- Conventions are requirements - not suggestions
- **When stuck, ask for help - don't guess**

This execution engine ensures I use templates naturally and automatically, making the system work as intended.
