# Task 51 Implement Stack Research ADR Skill - Handoff Summary

## Current State
- Task 51 implementation, independent review, Aegis closeout, and Taskmaster completion are
  complete.
- Branch: `feat/task-51-stack-research-adr-skill`.
- Session: `sessions/2026/07/2026-07-11-001-task51-stack-research-adr-skill.md`.
- Plan: `plans/2026-07-11-task51-stack-research-adr-skill.md`.
- Completed work-tracking: `docs/ai/work-tracking/archive/20260711-task51-stack-research-adr-skill-COMPLETED/`.
- Current work authority: `.aegis/state/current-work.json`.
- Reports: `docs/ai/work-tracking/archive/20260711-task51-stack-research-adr-skill-COMPLETED/reports/stack-research-adr-skill/`.

## What Was Done
- Created Aegis-native current work state.
- Created and linked current session and plan.
- Created active work-tracking folder with tracker, findings, decisions, implementation, changelog, handoff, designs, and reports surfaces.
- Added the canonical `stack-research-adr` skill, portable ADR/output contract, relative Codex
  link, project-authored catalog entry, bounded advisory route, fixtures, and focused tests.
- Reconciled independent review findings covering dual-source evidence, forward-router scope,
  reference coverage, and the unsupported authority label.
- Passed frozen install, Taskmaster, skill-platform, typecheck, lint, capability, build,
  auto-merge-policy, Aegis CI, completed-state guard, and diff checks.

## Current Issues/Blockers
- No implementation, review, or closeout blocker remains. Committed-head witness, GitHub
  secret scan, and required checks remain delivery gates.

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push the closed Task 51 branch.
2. Open a draft PR, wait for protected checks, and stop at the attended merge boundary.

## Important Context
- Authority is the project owner's explicit current instruction after PR #18:
  `authority=explicit-user:2026-07-10-task51-after-pr18`. Tracked grant v1 is unchanged and
  out of scope; no grant expansion is claimed.
- Taskmaster is optional unless this task marks it required in `.aegis/state/current-work.json`.
- Serena is optional continuity only and is not readiness evidence by itself.
- If context is compacted, resume by reading `.aegis/state/current-work.json`, `sessions/current`, `plans/current`, and this file.

## Implementation Evidence
- `.claude/skills/stack-research-adr/SKILL.md`
- `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`
## Verification Evidence
- `docs/ai/work-tracking/archive/20260711-task51-stack-research-adr-skill-COMPLETED/reports/stack-research-adr-skill/task-verification.md`
- `.aegis/reports/verification-report.json`
## Strict Verification Evidence
- `.aegis/reports/verification-report.json`
## Progress Log
- **2026-07-11 00:02 CEST** - [S:20260711|W:task51-stack-research-adr-skill|H:aegis:kickoff|E:.aegis/state/current-work.json] Handoff initialized by Aegis kickoff.
- **2026-07-11 00:02 CEST** - [S:20260711|W:task51-stack-research-adr-skill|H:agent:scope|E:docs/ai/work-tracking/active/20260711-task51-stack-research-adr-skill-ACTIVE/FINDINGS.md] authority=explicit-user:2026-07-10-task51-after-pr18; Task 51 only: canonical project-authored stack-research-adr skill, relative Codex link, catalog/review-map registration, portable ADR contract, deterministic fixtures/tests, Taskmaster projection, and Aegis/legacy evidence; no product, package, lockfile, workflow, authority-policy, branch-protection, or runtime changes
- **2026-07-11 00:07 CEST** - [S:20260711|W:task51-stack-research-adr-skill|H:agent:implementation|E:.claude/skills/stack-research-adr/SKILL.md] Implemented the project-authored stack research and ADR workflow with primary-source version verification, stable/support/security/compatibility/cost/lock-in/rollback criteria, explicit rejected alternatives, hostile-evidence boundaries, portable ADR output, relative Codex link, advisory registration, and focused positive/deny-path tests
- **2026-07-11 00:09 CEST** - [S:20260711|W:task51-stack-research-adr-skill|H:agent:time|E:cmd`date -Iseconds`] Recorded authoritative local timestamp 2026-07-11T00:08:52+02:00 before Task 51 verification evidence updates
- **2026-07-11 00:09 CEST** - [S:20260711|W:task51-stack-research-adr-skill|H:task-master:set-status|E:.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json] Moved only Taskmaster Task 51 to in-progress and regenerated only task_051.md through supported commands
- **2026-07-11 00:09 CEST** - [S:20260711|W:task51-stack-research-adr-skill|H:agent:decision|E:docs/ai/AEGIS_AUTONOMY_GRANT.md] Authority correction: the earlier pending-v2 label was unsupported and grants no authority. Task 51 is authorized by the project owner explicit current instruction after PR 18; tracked grant sota-magazine-2026-autonomy-v1 remains unchanged and out of scope for Task 51. authority=explicit-user:2026-07-10-task51-after-pr18
- **2026-07-11 00:12 CEST** - [S:20260711|W:task51-stack-research-adr-skill|H:agent:verification|E:docs/ai/work-tracking/active/20260711-task51-stack-research-adr-skill-ACTIVE/reports/stack-research-adr-skill/task-verification.md] Recorded Task 51 focused skill, workspace, Taskmaster, governance, guard, and review-remediation verification evidence; direct pnpm test remains the documented Task 39 baseline
- **2026-07-11 00:13 CEST** - [S:20260711|W:task51-stack-research-adr-skill|H:agent:verification|E:.aegis/reports/verification-report.json] Strict Aegis verification passed 31 checks with zero required failures while configured enforcement remained advisory
- **2026-07-11 00:16 CEST** - [S:20260711|W:task51-stack-research-adr-skill|H:agent:review|E:docs/ai/work-tracking/active/20260711-task51-stack-research-adr-skill-ACTIVE/reports/stack-research-adr-skill/task-verification.md] Independent implementation/completeness and adversarial security/authority/scope re-reviews passed with no actionable Task 51 findings
