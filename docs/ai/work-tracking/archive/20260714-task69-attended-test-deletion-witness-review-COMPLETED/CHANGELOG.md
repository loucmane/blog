## Progress Log
- **2026-07-14 18:52 CEST** - [S:20260714|W:task69-attended-test-deletion-witness-review|H:aegis:kickoff|E:.aegis/state/current-work.json] Changelog initialized by Aegis kickoff.
- **2026-07-14 18:58 CEST** - [S:20260714|W:task69-attended-test-deletion-witness-review|H:agent:implementation|E:scripts/ci/check-aegis.py] Implemented Task 69 fail-closed CI witness policy: ordinary witness passes remain unchanged; deletion-only diff_accounting failures pass the required check only as attended_review_required after exact Git deletion-set, head, base, schema, and all-other-check validation. Existing auto-merge test-removal denial remains authoritative. Added 18 focused/adversarial tests and wired them into the governance guard. authority=explicit-user-approval
- **2026-07-14 19:07 CEST** - [S:20260714|W:task69-attended-test-deletion-witness-review|H:agent:verification|E:docs/ai/work-tracking/active/20260714-task69-attended-test-deletion-witness-review-ACTIVE/reports/attended-test-deletion-witness-review/task-verification.md] Recorded Task 69 verification: 18 focused witness tests, 111 delivery-policy contracts, 13 runtime contracts, 29 quality contracts, 72 unit/integration tests with coverage, 16 browser/accessibility journeys, builds, smoke, zero-advisory audit, Taskmaster graph, capsule, guard, and diff checks passed. Local actionlint and Gitleaks binaries were unavailable and remain required hosted exact-head gates. authority=explicit-user-approval
- **2026-07-14 19:09 CEST** - [S:20260714|W:task69-attended-test-deletion-witness-review|H:agent:verification|E:.aegis/reports/verification-report.json] Strict Aegis verification failed on four pre-existing infrastructure gates unrelated to Task 69: stale external validator source versus the repo schema mirror, and clean main missing the owner-authorized uncommitted Codex hooks/delivery-policy rollout (codex.required_files, codex.hooks_registered, codex.hook_trust_guidance). No generic repair, runtime update, managed-asset copy, or bypass was attempted. Task 69 source/tests remain green; closeout and delivery are paused at this attended managed-runtime boundary. authority=explicit-user-approval
- **2026-07-14 22:22 CEST** - [S:20260714|W:task69-attended-test-deletion-witness-review|H:git:merge-main|E:commit:3a477efc113dd7bf4f2b2ee2f6c0592b5fc8070a] Merged synchronized `main` normally and preserved both Task 69 active evidence and Task 70 completed evidence. authority=standing-grant:sota-magazine-2026-autonomy-v2
- **2026-07-14 22:22 CEST** - [S:20260714|W:task69-attended-test-deletion-witness-review|H:agent:verification|E:docs/ai/work-tracking/active/20260714-task69-attended-test-deletion-witness-review-ACTIVE/reports/attended-test-deletion-witness-review/task-verification.md] Completed all available local verification; actionlint and Gitleaks remain exact-head hosted gates because their local executables are unavailable. authority=standing-grant:sota-magazine-2026-autonomy-v2
