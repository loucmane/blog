# Task 40 Migrate React Framework and Build System - Decisions

## Purpose
Record decisions before implementation, including options considered, rationale, and evidence.

## Decisions
- 2026-07-13 - Use Aegis-native current work as the portable workflow authority for this task. Taskmaster and Serena remain optional unless explicitly required.
- 2026-07-14 - Exact-pin Next.js `16.2.10`, React/React DOM `19.2.7`,
  `@types/react` `19.2.17`, and `@types/react-dom` `19.2.3`. These are the
  current stable registry releases, the selected Next major is Active LTS, the
  pairing is supported by Next's peer contract, and React `19.2.7` is beyond
  the patched `19.2.1` boundary for GHSA-fv66-9v8q-g76r.
- 2026-07-14 - Adopt Next 16's stable default Turbopack build path rather than
  preserving the obsolete custom Webpack chunking/SVGR configuration. No
  overlapping Vite application will be introduced; Vite remains test tooling.
  If a required SVG import appears, prefer an explicit asset/component boundary
  rather than retaining an unused global Webpack loader.
- 2026-07-14 - Preserve the owner-authorized managed Aegis rollout as
  pre-existing infrastructure state and leave every rollout path unstaged.
  Continue Task 40 with an explicit task-only staging inventory; never restore,
  remove, move, hide, inspect, or stage user-owned `.codex/`.
- 2026-07-14 - Remove `output: 'standalone'` and use the documented generic
  `next start` path as Task 40's portable Node baseline. Deployment packaging
  remains Task 46 and no provider-specific adapter is introduced here.
- 2026-07-14 - Replace the stale third-party CSP with a same-origin baseline.
  Production removes `unsafe-eval`; Next's static hydration still requires
  inline script/style compatibility until a measured nonce or hash strategy can
  preserve reader caching without making every route dynamic.

## Progress Log
- **2026-07-13 16:38 CEST** - [S:20260713|W:task40-migrate-react-next-framework-build-system|H:aegis:kickoff|E:.aegis/state/current-work.json] Decisions log initialized by Aegis kickoff.
- **2026-07-14 07:22 CEST** - [S:20260713|W:task40-migrate-react-next-framework-build-system|H:agent:decision|E:docs/ai/work-tracking/active/20260713-task40-migrate-react-next-framework-build-system-ACTIVE/DECISIONS.md] Selected the exact current stable Next 16/React 19.2 pair and Turbopack path. The owner classified the concurrent managed-runtime rollout as pre-existing infrastructure that must remain intact and unstaged, allowing Task 40 to proceed with an explicit task-only inventory. authority=standing-grant:sota-magazine-2026-autonomy-v2
